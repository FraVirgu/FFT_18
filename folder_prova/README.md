# Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Repository

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** algorithm in both sequential and parallel versions. FFT is a fundamental algorithm in digital signal processing, used to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its inverse efficiently.

The repository includes the following implementations:

1. **Sequential FFT**:
   - **Iterative**: A non-recursive implementation in C++.
   - **Recursive**: A divide-and-conquer implementation in C++.

2. **Parallel FFT**:
   - **CUDA Implementation**: A GPU-accelerated iterative FFT for high-performance computation.
   - **Multithreaded C++ Implementation**: A CPU-parallel iterative FFT using OpenMP directives.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the `/src` folder:
   ```bash
   cd src
   ```
2. Build the project using the `Makefile`:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. After compilation, a `/bin` folder will be created. Run the main executable:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

## Implementation Details

The `main()` function compares the execution of sequential and parallel FFT algorithms.  
- Two objects are created to execute the FFT using different approaches.
- The computational time for both methods is measured and their performance is compared.

## ITERATIVE/PARALLEL Overview


### Thread Data Flow

The data flow between threads during FFT computation is illustrated below:

Threads exchange data as needed to perform efficient FFT computations while minimizing global memory access.

### Thread Computation

Each thread computes part of the FFT independently. The process is depicted below:
